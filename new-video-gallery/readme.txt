= How It Works =

After installation, you get a dedicated "Video Gallery" section in your dashboard. From there, you can add videos by entering their YouTube or Vimeo IDs, upload custom thumbnail images, and organize them into galleries. Each gallery generates a unique shortcode that you can paste into any page, post, or widget area.

= What You Can Build =

* Product demonstration galleries for e-commerce sites
* Tutorial and course video collections
* Music and entertainment video showcases
* Client testimonial video walls
* Event highlight reels
* Portfolio presentations for creative professionals

= Key Capabilities =

**Multiple Video Sources**
Add videos from YouTube and Vimeo in the same gallery. The plugin handles both platforms seamlessly.

**Responsive Grid Layouts**
Galleries adapt to different screen sizes automatically. Your visitors get a smooth viewing experience whether they browse on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

**Lightbox Video Playback**
Videos open in an overlay player when clicked, keeping visitors on your page while they watch.

**Column Flexibility**
Choose from 1 to 4 columns per row. Adjust the layout separately for phones, tablets, laptops, and large displays.

**Custom Thumbnails**
Upload your own poster images instead of using auto-generated thumbnails for a more polished look.

**Simple Shortcode System**
Copy and paste shortcodes like `[VDGAL id=123]` to display galleries anywhere on your site.
